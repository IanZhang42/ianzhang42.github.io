                <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
                <p>I'm a graduate student at the University of Toronto, currently working towards my masters in statistics, which I expect to obtain in 2026. I recently received my BSc in statistics and mathematics from UofT. </p>
                <p>My research interests lie in the more applied realm of statistics, currently focusing in genetics and neuroimaging. I am currently working with the Xia Lab at McGill University to extend and optimized the mGWASR package in R, which provides functions to conduct metabolite GWAS studies, as well as a curated database of significant SNP-metabolite associations. As of now, I am implementing IV selection and updating the package to match current syntax and standards.</p>
